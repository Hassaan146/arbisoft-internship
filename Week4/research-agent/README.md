# Research Agent (Week 4)

A single AI research agent that answers multi-hop questions using **web search**, **page fetching**, **local file reading (.txt/.pdf)**, and **automatic session memory** — with every tool call intercepted by **hooks** (validation, structured logging, metrics). Hand-rolled ReAct loop on Groq's OpenAI-compatible function-calling API; no agent framework.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # add your GROQ_API_KEY and SERPAPI_API_KEY
```

Free keys: [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) and [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com).
(SerpAPI is used instead of the originally planned Brave Search API because Brave's signup site was down at build time; the provider is isolated in `tools/search.py`.)

## Run

```bash
python main.py            # interactive chat (terminal)
python main.py --demo     # scripted multi-hop demo (file -> memory -> 2-hop search -> memory-only recall)
uvicorn server:app --port 8010   # Agentika web UI -> open http://localhost:8010
pytest tests/ -q          # unit tests, no API keys needed (APIs mocked / not called)
ruff check . && ruff format --check .   # lint + formatting (config in pyproject.toml)
```

## Web frontend (Agentika)

Single-page glassmorphism chat UI (`web/index.html`, served by `server.py`):
a self-contained layered-gradient background (no external video/CDN asset), a
hero that collapses into a ChatGPT-style thread on first message, typewriter
reply animation with a 3-dot thinking indicator, green/white palette, and a
system-font stack (no Google Fonts dependency, so it renders identically
offline). A **New session** control clears the server-side memory for that
browser. Each browser gets its **own** session agent (see *Sessions* below).

**Flow per turn:** user input → memory injects top-k relevant facts into the system prompt → LLM plans → registry validates args (Pydantic), runs pre-hooks (may block), executes the tool, runs post-hooks (log + metrics) → observation appended → loop (≤ `MAX_STEPS`, then a forced no-tools best-effort answer) → final answer → extraction LLM call stores durable facts into memory.

## Design decisions

### Memory is architecture, not a tool
The agent never "decides" to remember. After every turn, a separate extraction call pulls durable facts (`{"key", "value"}` JSON) into `MemoryStore`. Same key → newest value overwrites, old value kept in `Fact.history`. Before every turn, facts are ranked by keyword overlap with the user message (recency breaks ties; zero-overlap facts fill remaining slots so "summarize the session" works) and the top-k are injected into the system prompt. Token-overlap scoring instead of embeddings is deliberate: transparent, dependency-free, sufficient for one session.

### Hooks are deterministic control around a probabilistic model
The registry always runs `pre_tool_use` (sandbox validation — can block a call), `post_tool_use` and `on_tool_error` (JSONL logging with `ts / tool / args / duration_ms / status / error / result_preview`, plus metrics counters). Adding a hook is appending a function to a list.

### Errors are observations
`dispatch()` never raises. Validation failures, policy blocks, and exceptions all return `ToolResult{ok, data, error}` — the error text goes back to the model, which adapts (the system prompt forbids repeating an identical failing call). Transient HTTP failures (timeout/429/5xx) are retried with exponential backoff (`utils.retry_http`); auth/bad-input errors fail fast. Missing API keys exit with a one-line fix instruction at startup.

### File reading is sandboxed
`read_file` resolves the path and requires it inside `docs/` (blocks `../` and absolute paths — checked both in the tool and in a pre-hook, defense in depth), allows only `.txt`/`.pdf`, caps size (5 MB) and output length (8k chars).

### Search behavior
`web_search` returns Google results via SerpAPI (answer-box included when present). The system prompt instructs: search first, `fetch_page` a specific URL only when snippets aren't enough.

### Why no LangChain?
The course goal is conceptual clarity: this loop is ~400 lines with every moving part visible. Mapping to framework equivalents: `registry.py` ≈ LangChain `@tool` + `bind_tools`, `memory.py` ≈ checkpointer/store, `hooks.py` ≈ callbacks, `agent.py` ≈ `create_react_agent`. Trade-off: frameworks give integrations and tracing for free; here you see and own everything.

### Prompts
Both prompts live as constants in `agent.py`:
- **`SYSTEM_PROMPT`** — role, ReAct guidance, tool policy (search→fetch escalation, cite URLs, adapt to tool errors, admit uncertainty), plus the injected "Known facts" block.
- **`EXTRACTION_PROMPT`** — strict-JSON fact extraction, instructed to reuse existing keys so updates overwrite instead of duplicating.

### Sessions (web server)
The CLI is one process = one user. The web server, though, can be opened by
anyone and serves requests concurrently, so a single shared agent would mean
every visitor shares one memory and overlapping requests corrupt one history.
`server.py` therefore gives **each browser its own `Agent`** (own memory +
history), keyed by a cookie; idle sessions expire after `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`
(bounding memory growth), a `SESSION_MAX` LRU cap bounds total sessions, and
requests within a session are serialised so concurrency can't interleave turns.
Memory is **in-process only** — it lives in RAM and is lost on server restart
or when the session expires (no database).

### Security
- **SSRF guard** (`tools/search.py`): `fetch_page` allows only http(s) and
  refuses hosts resolving to private/loopback/link-local/reserved ranges,
  re-validating on every redirect — blocks the cloud metadata endpoint
  (`169.254.169.254`) and internal hosts.
- **Prompt-injection framing**: tool observations enter the context wrapped in
  `<tool_output>` delimiters, and the system prompt marks everything inside as
  untrusted data, never instructions.
- **Abuse controls**: a server-side `MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS` cap (the client
  `maxlength` is UX only) and a per-IP token-bucket rate limit
  (`RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`).

### Config
Everything tunable lives in `config.py` (overridable via `.env`; see
`.env.example` for the full list): `MODEL`, `MAX_STEPS` (default 8 — a hard
cost/latency ceiling per turn; on hitting it the agent gives a best-effort
answer and says what's unverified), planner/extraction `TEMPERATURE`/`MAX_TOKENS`,
`MEMORY_TOP_K`, `HISTORY_MAX_MESSAGES`/`HISTORY_HARD_CAP`, `SEARCH_COUNT`,
size/truncation limits, `HTTP_TIMEOUT`/`HTTP_MAX_REDIRECTS`, retry knobs,
`LOG_PREVIEW_CHARS`, and the session/rate-limit settings above. Keys are
validated on first real use, not at import, so tests run keyless.

## Verified behavior (2026-07-15)

- `pytest tests/ -q` → **50 passed** (registry, memory, file sandbox, hooks, plus
  the agent ReAct loop with a scripted fake client, the SSRF guard, session
  isolation/TTL/LRU, and the server input cap + rate limit).
- `python main.py --demo` → full run: reads txt + pdf, extracts facts, resolves
  "the company" from memory, 2-hop web search for the CEO, final turn answered
  from memory with zero tool calls; metrics + `tool_calls.jsonl` produced.
- Negative paths: missing `.env` → clean startup message; `../` traversal →
  blocked by policy hook; `.exe` → rejected; wrong tool args → readable
  validation error back to the model.
